            <h1 class="font-bold">Question-01:Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h1>
            <p>The scope of variables in JavaScript is determined by their declaration keywords:</p>
        
            <h2 class="font-semibold">var Scope:</h2>
            <p>The <code>var</code> keyword introduces variables with either function scope or global scope. Variables declared with <code>var</code> are subject to hoisting, where declarations are moved to the top of their enclosing function or global context. This can lead to unexpected behavior as <code>var</code> variables can be accessed before they are formally declared within the same scope.</p>
        
            <h2 class="font-semibold">let Scope:</h2>
            <p>The <code>let</code> keyword introduces block-scoped variables. These variables are confined to the nearest enclosing block, whether it's a loop, a conditional statement, or a function. Unlike <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> variables are not hoisted to the top of their block. They are only accessible after their declaration within the block, promoting clearer scoping and preventing scope-related issues.</p>
        
            <h2 class="font-semibold">const Scope:</h2>
            <p>The <code>const</code> keyword introduces block-scoped variables with the additional characteristic of being constants. This means their value cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. Similar to <code>let</code>, <code>const</code> variables are block-scoped and are only accessible after their declaration within the block. They ensure controlled scoping and are particularly useful when maintaining constant values throughout their scope.</p>
        
            <p>In modern JavaScript development, using <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> is recommended over <code>var</code> due to their more precise scoping and alignment with contemporary programming practices.</p> <br>

            <h1 class="font-bold">Question-02:Use Cases of null and undefined.</h1>
            <p><strong>null:</strong></p>
            <p>The value <code>null</code> represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used when you want to indicate that a variable or object property has no meaningful value or hasn't been initialized yet. For example, you might set a variable to <code>null</code> when you want to clear its previous value.</p>
            
            <p><strong>undefined:</strong></p>
            <p>The value <code>undefined</code> typically indicates that a variable or object property has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It is often the default value for uninitialized variables. JavaScript assigns <code>undefined</code> to variables that have been declared but haven't been explicitly given a value.</p>
            
            <p>Understanding the use cases of <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> is essential for writing clean and robust JavaScript code.</p> <br>

            <h1 class="font-bold"> Question-03:What is a REST API?</h1>
            <p>A REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of principles and constraints for designing web services. It allows different software systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods.</p>
            <p>Key features of REST APIs include a stateless architecture, resource-based URLs, and uniform interfaces. They are widely used for building web applications and enabling interactions between various services.</p>
